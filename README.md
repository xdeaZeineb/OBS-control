# OBS Control Monolith
This project combines both the frontend and backend services to create a unified application for controlling and monitoring OBS (Open Broadcaster Software). The backend connects to OBS using WebSockets and provides API endpoints, while the frontend (built with Svelte) communicates with the backend to display real-time updates and interact with OBS.
